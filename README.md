## Expo app

#### 1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd expo
   npm install
   ```

#### 2. Set environment variables
In `expo/` copy this to a `.env` file.
```
NODE_ENV=development
EXPO_PUBLIC_HOST=<IP Addr>:8080
```
Get IP Addr by running `npx expo start` in the `expo/` directory.
One of the log lines is `Metro waiting on exp://<IP Addr>:8081`.
⚠️ The address that expo shows is port 8081, but it must be 8080 in your `.env`.

In the root directory, make a new `.env` file.
```
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
JWT_SECRET=<secret>
```
Get your JWT_SECRET from https://jwtsecret.com/generate.

#### 3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).


#### 4. From the root directory, run `docker compose up` to run the go server and postgres/migrate/sqlc

this is set up to work with docker but you should probably install golang migrate, sqlc, and go yourself.

`brew install golang-migrate`

To create a new migration, run migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migrations -seq {name_of_migration}

To access the db directly, run
`docker exec -it chat-app-db-1 bash`
`psql -U postgres`
`\c postgres`
